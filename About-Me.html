				<h2><b>My childhood and my story in America</b></h2>
			</header>
			<p>First of all, please allow me to introdue myself. My name is Chan and original was born and raised in SouthEast Asia.
				When I first moved to United States, it was culture shocked to me. I had to learn a new language and culture while maitaining my heritage. I had a great time in my high shcool year. I've made many friends during high school.
				I also was part of vasity soccer team. I was so lucky to receive scholarships for my college. Although, America has offered a lot of good memory but I still miss my home town, my family, friends, and especially I cannot forget the food.
